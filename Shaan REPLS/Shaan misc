'''The time complexity of my function is O(n) , 
as the only thing that matters is the isze of the array, bceacus i only had one for loop on line 9.
also i had to resist the urge of creating numeours variable to store things like finalIndex, and such to keep memory usage down.
as im writing this i realized i could go back and change the code so as to not store the value for totalLen, i could replace it in the code to len(arr) for each use of the variable (lines 7,9,19) i just dont feel like to ging back to change it lulz'''
