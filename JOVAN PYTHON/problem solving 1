### write a function that takes two inputs from the user and multiplies and displays them back and returns the multiplied result
## the first input is an int
## the second input is a float
## name of function is going to be intXfloat()

## declare a variable with the variablle name intInput, and store into it the value of the input function with the paramater of the string with the question 'What is your first number? : '

## declare a variable with the variablle name floatInput, and store into it the value of the input function with the paramater of the string with the question 'What is your second number? : '

## create a variable with then variable name result, and store into it the value of the ultiplication of intInput and Float input

## usint eh print function print out the result in a nice String to the user of the function

## return result

## call and test the function (MAKE SURE YOU ARE OUTSIDTHE FUNCTION)
def intXfloat():

  intInput = int(input("What is your first number (INTEGER) : "))
  floatInput = float(input("What is your second number (FLOAT) : "))

  result = intInput * floatInput


  print("The result is : ",result)

  return result

intXfloat()


## using the print function, print out the result (variable) in a nice String(passed as a paramater to the print function) to the user of the function

## in todays class we learnt more about problem solving skills
## we learnt how to create a function and how to name them 
## we learnt again how to take user input and force the data type to change from string to float or int
## we learnt how to test and run code and catch bugs and how to fix them
