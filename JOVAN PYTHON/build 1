	'''
	Functionality
	-------------
	(none) -> list

	Paramaters
	-------------
	0. This function has no paramaters

	Description
	-------------	
	This fucntion takes 0 paramaters.
	This function takes a user input as an integer, for the number of parts to build, it stores this value into numOfParts.
	Using a list with the the name listOfParts, we take an input from the user, with the name of the part to build, and add this to the list for the number of parts required.

	Example
	----------
	> build()
	how many parts do we need to build? : 0
	We need to build:  []
	[]

	> build()
	how many parts do we need to build? : 2
	What is the part you need? : Living room
	What is the part you need? : Roof
	We need to build:  ['Living room', 'Roof']
	['Living room', 'Roof']
	'''
	numOfParts = int(input("how many parts do we need to build? : "))
	listOfParts = [] 

	while numOfParts > 0:
		user_input = input("What is the part you need? : ")
		numOfParts -= 1
		listOfParts.append(user_input)

	print("We need to build: ",listOfParts)

	return listOfParts

	(int) -> list

	Paramaters
	-------------
	1. numOfParts is an integer that is used to determine the length for listOfParts

	Description:
	------------
	This fucntion takes 1 paramater, numOfPArts, and this will determine the size of listOfParts
	Using a list with the the name listOfParts, we take an input from the user, with the name of the part to build, and add this to the list for the number of parts required.

	Examples:
	---------


	'''
	listOfParts = [] 

	while numOfParts > 0:
		user_input = input("What is the part you need? : ")
		numOfParts -= 1
		listOfParts.append(user_input)

	print("We need to build: ",listOfParts)

	return listOfParts
