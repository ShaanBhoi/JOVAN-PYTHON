### functions we created last class, we are going to add a feature to have addition and sutractiion
### todays class we are goin to fill in the two new functions, addition and subtraction

### STEP 1: in the function addition, create a variable with the name sum , and store inside of it the value of the addition of num1 & num2  
### STEP 2: using the print functions, print out a sentence that makes sense using num1, num2 and the sum that is easy to understand
### STEP 3: call the function addition and see if it works
	###STEP 3.1: call the function using 1&2 , 10&7, before you should think of the answers
	### BONUS store the first two function calls in their respective variable name first, second, and create a new variable called third that stores the addition of first and second as paramaters
def addition(num1, num2):
	sum = num1 + num2
	print(num1,"+",num2," = ",sum)
	return sum
"""
first = addition(1,2)
second = addition(10,7)
third = addition(first,second)
"""
### STEP 4: create a variable with the name res1, that stores the value of num1 minus num2 
	### STEP 4.1 : create a variable with the name res2, that stores the value of num2 minus num1
### STEP 5: Using the print function , create two outpts that make snese with the vaariables form the function
### STEP 6: call and test the function with 3&5 , 10&5
def subtraction(num1, num2):
	res1 = num1 - num2 
	res2 = num2 - num1

	print(num1,"-",num2," = ",res1)
	print(num2,"-",num1," = ",res2)

	return True

subtraction(3,5)
subtraction(10,5)
