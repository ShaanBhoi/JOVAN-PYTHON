### define a function with the name isLeapYear() on line 2
def isLeapYear():

  ### create a variable year, that stores the integer of the user input with the question : "What year do you want to check if it is a leap year?"
  year = int(input("what year do you want to check if it is a leap year? : "))
  ### we want to force year to be an integer using the int() function, to do this we need to use the int function and pass it the paramater year

  ### using conditional descision making, we can create some logic using the if statment, and see if (year%4) > 0 , if that is true we need to say that it is not a leap year, otherwise if this condition is false, we can say that it is a leap year   

  
  if (year%4) >0 :
    print(year," is not a leap year")
  else:
      print(year, "is a leap year")

isLeapYear()

### today we learnt how create a function and use an if statment inside of ite
## we also learnt how to force the stroage of an int from a user strin ginout
# we learnt how to call a function 
# how to debug our code when we encounter errors in the terminal at runtime
