#    We need to come up with a solution to count vowels in a string     #
#########################################################################

##################    1. create a list of vowels
##    srategy   ##    2. loop through each element in the list  
##################    3. add one to the total count of vowels


## define a function with the name vowelCounter(inputSentence)
def vowelCounter(inputSentence) :
  ## create a list with the variable name englishVowels, and store in it the elements of each seperate vowel as a string.
  LowEnglishVowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
  CapEnglishVowels = ["A","E","I","O","U"]
  
  allVowels = LowEnglishVowels + CapEnglishVowels

  ##  we are going to make a for loop, and go through each char in the sentence and compare it to each vowel in allVowels, if we find a vowel, we will increment vowel count
  vowelCount = 0 


  for j in range(0,len(inputSentence)):
    for k in range(0,len(allVowels)):
        #print("is ",inputSentence[j] ," equal to ", allVowels[k])
        if inputSentence[j] == allVowels[k]:
            vowelCount = vowelCount + 1
            #print(vowelCount)

  print("we found a total of",vowelCount,"vowels in the sentence", inputSentence)
  return vowelCount
### declare a variable with the name mySentence and store into it a string of anything you like
mySentence = "hello my name is anoop dhanjal "

## call the function vowelCounter() and give it the paramater mySentence

vowelCounter(mySentence)

### we learnt a little bit more on functions, how to cll and creat functions
## we learnt how to use for loops and if statements in functions
## we learn what to return and how we can reuse functions to come upt with a solution to many problems
