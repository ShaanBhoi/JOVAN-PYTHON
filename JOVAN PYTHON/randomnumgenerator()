### make a function generateRandomNum() , it takes two.. user inputs for upper and lower bounds (sotored as variables), and outputs a random integer between upper bound and lower bounds

import random 

def generateRandomNum():

	'''
	functionality:
	_______________

	(none) -> int

	paramaters:
	______________
	 0. This function has no parameters

	description:
	______________
	This function takes two user inputs (as integers) for lower and upper bounds and calls on the function randint( ) from random, to compute a random number inside our upper and lower bounds. Prints information in nice format. Returns the random number generated.

	example:
	______________

	Call from T.E.

	what is the highest possible number? : 55
	what is the lowest possible number? : 50
	your random number between [ 50 , 55 ] is:  54
	> 

	'''

	upper = int(input("what is the highest possible number? : "))
	lower = int(input("what is the lowest possible number? : "))

	randomNumberRes = random.randint(lower,upper)

	print("your random number between [",lower,",",upper,"] is: ", randomNumberRes )
	return randomNumberRes
