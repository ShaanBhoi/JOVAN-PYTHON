INSTRUCTIONS:
1. define a function with the name legoSetChecker (ownedSetList,checkSet)
2. re-create the if/else statment with the updated variable names from the paramaters passed to the function

## condition : (checkSet in ownedSetList)

		print(myCheckElement," is in the list")
		return True

		print(myCheckElement," is not in the list")

## we took a program that was not a functction and made it into a function
## we changed out functtion to be able to handle more than just lego sets, now it can check if any element that is a string is in the list passed as a pararamater
