## todays class we are going to learn about creating a data structure 
## the prurpose of this structure is to see if we already have the name of the lego set
## create a list of sets that we own,and we are going to have a funtion that will check weather that nweset (given as a param ) already exists in the list of legoSets that we already own

### STEP 0 : create a list of setsOwned, and fill it with the string values of the sets we know we have already
### STEP 1 : take user input, with the question as a param "do i have this lego set" 
		### STEP 1.2	store above value into a variable named legoSet
### STEP 2 :  we have to create an if/else statement that returns true or false
		### STEP 2.2	condition is if (legoSet in setsOwned)
			### if true print we own this set, and retrun True
			### if !true print we dont have this set, and return False


setsOwned = ["skullarina","zombiecave","tiaga","pillager outpost","panda nersary "]
legoSet = input("Do i have : ")

if (legoSet in setsOwned):
	print("I have ",legoSet)
else:
	print("I don't have ",legoSet)
